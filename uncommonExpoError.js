This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo that isn't available in the managed workflow or requires a specific setup.  For instance, directly using native modules or relying on functionalities not fully supported by Expo's abstractions might cause this.  Another reason could be incorrect configuration files, like `app.json` or `package.json`, that prevent Expo from correctly recognizing and integrating necessary dependencies.  Finally, there might be compatibility issues between Expo's version and other packages or SDKs used in your project.
