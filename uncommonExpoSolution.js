The solution depends on the specific error.  Common approaches:

1. **Verify Expo SDK Version Compatibility:** Ensure your Expo SDK version aligns with the dependencies you're using. Check the Expo documentation for compatibility information.
2. **Check Package.json and App.json:** Carefully review these files. Typos, incorrect paths, or missing configurations can lead to errors.  Ensure all plugins and dependencies are correctly specified.
3. **Examine Expo's logs:** Expo usually provides detailed logs that may pinpoint the exact cause.  Look for warnings and errors in the output generated by the CLI.
4. **Isolate the problematic code:** If you can reproduce the error, try to narrow down the code causing it by commenting out sections systematically. 
5. **Consult the Expo Community:** If you're still stuck, post the error message and the relevant code snippets on the Expo forums or community channels. Others may have experienced similar issues.
6. **Eject (as a last resort):** In rare circumstances, ejecting from the managed workflow might be necessary, but it is not recommended unless absolutely required, as it removes some of the benefits of using Expo.
